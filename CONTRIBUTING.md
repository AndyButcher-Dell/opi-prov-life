# Contributing

dbluff-opi-prov-life uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you are a new contributor see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request,
  addressing (with `@...`) a suitable maintainer of this repository (see
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) in the description of the pull request.

* Be sure to sign off on the [DCO](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the
GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts
from contributors on the same issue.

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the main branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main branch
  before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with main
  you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment. The project will soon have an IRC and/or Slack channel setup, which
  will also become a useful way to notify a maintainer.

* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
